I used 3 layers with 100 65 and 40 neurons respectively using tanh activation

After multiple tries I was unable to break 75%

I added a layer, changed the activation function, increased the number of neurons and added dropthrough layers

Summary:

Overall, a regression model would be more suited for this task. Neural Networks are excellent at finding results with more complicatd data such as audio or image-based data, but can be overcomplicated, and unnecessarily slow for a task such as this one, which can even be done with old fashioned hand-done regression algorithms
